# NumericalAnalysis

Implements Methods from Numerical Analysis by Timothy Sauer

This repository is my personal implementation of the algorithms for my numerical analysis class. There's nothing earth-shattering here, it's all stuff that's very common. I did it for personal practice. I want to put it here as a backup for my computer. Also, I make no claim as to the accuracy of it all. I've tested it all and it has worked on everything that I have tried, but I don't have time to go through it all and make sure for a ton of cases. Also, I can't guarantee at the efficiency of the code. I do pretty well at that, but I also don't have time to do that, either. If any of it is helpful for you, you can go ahead and use it, I don't mind.
